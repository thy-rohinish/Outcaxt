# OUTCAxT
"A decentralized communication and storage platform focused on untraceability, unbreakability, and self-healing."


## Objective
The objective of the Outcaxt project is to create a decentralized communication and storage platform that empowers users with secure, untraceable, and resilient data exchange capabilities. By leveraging advanced encryption techniques, decentralized blockchain principles, and innovative mesh networking technology, Outcaxt aims to:

1. **Enhance Privacy**: Ensure that all communications and data storage are end-to-end encrypted, preventing unauthorized access and interception.
2. **Decentralize Control**: Eliminate single points of failure and control by distributing data across a peer-to-peer network, making the system robust against attacks and failures.
3. **Promote Scalability**: Begin as a simple communication tool while providing the potential for growth into a comprehensive decentralized internet, supporting various applications such as secure messaging, private browsing, and encrypted file sharing.
4. **Foster an Open Ecosystem**: Build upon and contribute to open-source technologies, enabling collaboration with global developers and researchers to continually enhance security features and user experience.
5. **Ensure Resilience**: Implement a self-healing architecture that allows the system to adapt and reroute data seamlessly in the event of node failures or attacks, ensuring continuous service availability

## Vision
Outcaxt envisions a future where users have full control over their data, communication, and online identities, free from the constraints of centralized authorities and surveillance, fostering a more secure and equitable digital environment.

## Overview
Outcaxt is a decentralized platform for secure communication and storage. It uses strong encryption, blockchain, and mesh networking to keep user data private and untraceable. With a peer-to-peer system, Outcaxt removes the risks of centralized control, making it more secure and reliable. As an open-source project, it invites global collaboration to create a future where users have complete control over their data and communication.


## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Backend server handling connections, data transmission, and security.
- **Rust**: Client-side communication for enhanced performance and safety.
- **Websockets**: Real-time communication between server and clients.
- **Cryptography**: For secure data transmission and storage.


## Project Goals
Build a secure, decentralized communication system.
Implement advanced encryption using modern cryptography.
Explore peer-to-peer networking and decentralized internet
